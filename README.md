# IGTV PRODUCT PERFORMANCE 
This project is part of the data science bootcamp hosted by Lux Academy.
Assuming you are a product data scientist at Instagram, how would the success of the Instagram TV product(IGTV) be measured. This is the what this project seeks to answer.
In this case, there are several different perspectives that could be considered to achieve the desired result that will ultimately inform the business decision.
These angles are;
1. User Engagement metrics - The frequency of interaction the consumers have with the different types of content.
2. Content Metrics - Examine the performance of the content on the IGTV.
3. User Growth and Adoption Metrics - Monitoring of user performance on IGTV.
4. Monetization Metrics - Revenue Generation in relation to the platform growth and content created.
5. User Feedback and Satisfaction - Feedback on how the consumer feels about the content and their interaction with the IGTV.
6. Competitive Analysis - Comparison of how the performance of IGTV is in relation to other similar products in the market.
7. Content Creator Metrics - Measuring how frequently content creators are using IGTV for their content creation
8. Market Impact - The monitoring of how the product has made an impact in the social media space and its overall contribution to the Instagram user base.
9. Strategic Metrics - Ensure that the success metrics align with the business needs and direction.

In this case, we will use User Growth and Adoption metrics(point 3). Here will answer the following;

a. User Registration - This metric helps gauge the initial interest and adoption of IGTV among Instagram users.

b. Active Users - Monitor the percentage of Instagram users who engage with IGTV regularly

c. User Retention - Analyze the rate at which users continue to use IGTV over time
